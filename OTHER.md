The main page focuses on the **Resident Diplomatic Missions**—those embassies and consulates that physically operate an office in Dublin.

There are indeed **many countries missing** for two main reasons:

### 1. Non-Resident Embassies (Accredited from London or elsewhere)

The majority of countries in the world maintain diplomatic relations with Ireland, but they **do not have a physical Embassy in Dublin** to save costs. Instead, their Ambassador based in another country (most commonly **London**) is accredited to Ireland on a non-resident basis.

This means you cannot go to an office in Dublin for visa or consular services; you must contact their Embassy in the UK or their nearest office.

**Examples of countries accredited from London that are not in the table:**

* **Asia/Middle East:** Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Brunei, Kuwait, Myanmar, Nepal, Oman, Qatar, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Uzbekistan.
* **Africa:** Angola, Botswana, Ghana (closed Dublin mission in 2009), Namibia, Senegal, Somalia, Tanzania, Zambia.
* **Americas:** Bahamas, Belize, Bolivia, Cuba (though listed in the previous table, its status has been complex and sometimes non-resident), Uruguay, Venezuela.
* **Europe:** Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, North Macedonia, Serbia.

### 2. Honorary Consulates (The most numerous and hardest to track)

There are approximately **100 countries** that maintain an Honorary Consul in Ireland. Because these roles are often held by private citizens operating from their own businesses, they are numerous, change frequently, and can be difficult to list exhaustively in a simple table.

**Examples of Honorary Consulates not explicitly listed in the previous table:**

* **Singapore:** Often listed as an Honorary Consulate General in Dublin.
* **Serbia:** Maintains an Honorary Consulate.
* **Moldova:** Has an Embassy accredited in Dublin, which may have been missed in the previous list.
* **Belarus:** Historically had an Embassy, now often represented by an Honorary Consul.
* **Armenia:** Maintains an Honorary Consulate.

If you have a specific country in mind that was not listed, I can check where their non-resident Embassy is located.
