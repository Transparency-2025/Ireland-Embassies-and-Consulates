Adding scoring or grading to the methodology makes the assessment quantitative and allows for a clearer comparison of data quality across different areas of the repository.

Here is the updated assessment methodology, incorporating a 5-point scoring system for the four core criteria: Originality, Completeness, Value/Importance, and Accuracy/Timeliness.

## 📊 Updated Assessment Methodology: Scoring & Grades

This methodology uses a 5-point scale (1=Poor, 5=Excellent) for each criterion to provide a quantifiable assessment of the repository's quality.

---

### **1. 💯 Originality**

Measures the uniqueness of the data compilation and the value added by cross-classification.

| Score | Description | Rationale (Contextual) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **5 (Excellent)** | Unique consolidation of disparate data sets. | Combines **Geopolitical** (Continent/Region), **Commercial** (EMEA/APAC/NAM/LATAM), and **Diplomatic Contact** (Resident vs. Non-Resident/Accreditation Location). |
| **3 (Good)** | Uses common data with some unique structuring. | If it were just a standard list of countries and their Dublin embassies. |
| **1 (Poor)** | Simple listing of easily accessible public domain data. | If it only listed UN member states. |

---

### **2. ✅ Completeness**

Measures the depth of coverage, focusing on both sovereign entities and contact information.

| Score | Measurement Metric | Current Repository Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **5 (Excellent)** | All 195 recognized states are listed, and contact details are provided for >90% of all mission types (Resident, Non-Resident, Honorary). | *Status:* **Not Achieved.** Sovereign list is complete, but Non-Resident contact is limited, and Honorary Consulates are explicitly noted as hard to track and underrepresented. |
| **3 (Good)** | All 195 states listed; all **Resident Missions** have complete contact data; **Non-Resident Missions** are listed with the *accrediting* city. | *Status:* **Achieved.** All sovereign states are listed. Resident missions are fully documented. Non-resident missions are listed with the primary location (London, etc.). |
| **1 (Poor)** | Only a partial list of sovereign states; contact details are missing for over half of the resident missions. | *Status:* **Not Achieved.** |

### **3. 💡 Value/Importance**

Measures the practical utility of the data for the most relevant target audience (citizens, business, and researchers in Ireland).

| Score | Description | Target Audience Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **5 (Excellent)** | High utility across **all** audiences. | Crucial for **Citizens** (Non-Resident consular access) and **Business** (EMEA/APAC classification for market analysis). |
| **3 (Good)** | Highly useful for one specific audience but limited for others. | Useful only for a citizen trying to find a Dublin embassy. |
| **1 (Poor)** | Data is only of academic interest with no practical application. | Limited utility. |

---

### **4. ⌚ Accuracy/Timeliness**

Measures the correctness and currency of the diplomatic status and contact information.

| Score | Description | Rationale (Contextual) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **5 (Excellent)** | Statuses are explicitly up-to-date and include recent changes. | Recently closed missions (Israel, Ethiopia) are documented, indicating high maintenance and validation of the data. |
| **3 (Good)** | Contact details appear correct, but no recent closure/status changes are mentioned. | Assumes most addresses/phones are current without recent confirmation. |
| **1 (Poor)** | Multiple missions are listed as open when they are known to be closed or have incorrect contact information. | Significant errors in basic contact details. |

## 🚀 SWOG Analysis Summary

Based on the scoring metrics, the repository is highly original and valuable, with strong accuracy regarding diplomatic status.

| Category | Assessment | Rationale from Scoring |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Strengths** | **Originality (Score: 5)** & **Value (Score: 5)** | Unique cross-classification of geopolitical, business, and diplomatic data. Excellent utility for citizens and business analysts. |
| **Weaknesses** | **Completeness (Score: 3/5)** | Coverage of **Honorary Consulates** is limited, and specific contact details for non-resident Irish affairs are missing for most accrediting embassies. |
| **Gaps/Opportunities** | **Data Expansion** | Opportunity to achieve a higher Completeness score by documenting the approximately 100 Honorary Consulates and identifying direct Irish Desk contacts in London/other accrediting capitals. |
