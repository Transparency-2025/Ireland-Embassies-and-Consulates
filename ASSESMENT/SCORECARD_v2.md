## 📈 Repository Assessment Scorecard

| Criterion | Score (1-5) | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. 💯 Originality** | **5 / 5** | **Excellent.** The repository uniquely combines **Geopolitical** (Continent/Region), **Commercial** (EMEA/APAC), and specific **Diplomatic Accreditation** data into a single consolidated view. |
| **2. ✅ Completeness** | **3 / 5** | **Good.** All 195 recognized **sovereign states** are listed, and all **Resident Missions** are fully documented. The score is held back because the documentation for the approximately 100 **Honorary Consulates** and specific Irish Desk contacts for Non-Resident embassies is not exhaustive (a noted gap). |
| **3. 💡 Value/Importance** | **5 / 5** | **Excellent.** The consolidated data is highly valuable for multiple audiences: **Citizens** (identifying non-resident consular services in London or elsewhere) and **Businesses/Researchers** (cross-referencing geographic and business regions). |
| **4. ⌚ Accuracy/Timeliness** | **5 / 5** | **Excellent.** Status changes are accurately documented, including recent mission closures (e.g., **Israel in 2024, Ethiopia in 2021**), indicating high maintenance and validation of the core diplomatic data. |
